% gpsWeek -------- The unambiguous GPS week number where zero corresponds
%                  to midnight on the evening of 5 January/morning of 6
%                  January, 1980.  By unambiguous is meant the full week
%                  count since the 1980 reference time (no rollover at
%                  1024 weeks).
%
% gpsSec --------- The GPS time of week expressed as GPS seconds from
%                  midnight on Saturday.
